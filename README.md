## Introduction
One of the major issues of using beauty products is not knowing how they will appear on our faces. As an example, most lipsticks are selected based on the color we see in the product. Therefore, we develop a solution to overcome that problem. It's GlowMe.

GlowMe is a realistic makeover and virtual makeup application tools to assist in locating the ideal makeup products for the customers. Virtual try-on, foundation shade finder, Eyeliner, Lipstick, and more features.

The web application will be developed first, followed by a mobile version with updated functionality. Augmented Reality is employed in this product to perfectly match the shade to the skin tone. Lipstick tones match the lip colour, hairstyle, hair colour that precisely integrates with the hair tone, nail polishes that match perfectly with finger skin colour and nail shape, and eye lenses that best suit the eyes.

The app is completely capable of carrying out a beauty try-on on a live video simulation. Following the basic app, we intend to create a software application for promoting beauty products. The Reminder feature allows the consumer to be reminded of the daily usage times and health tips. Identify the challenges that the user is experiencing with her face and propose appropriate items to help them overcome them.

### The Uniqueness 
This app would perform a facial try-on on a live video simulation. Using data science and image processing, it can track facial details. Identify the problems in users' faces and recommend appropriate items to treat them, making use of artificial intelligence. Moreover, this is an online marketplace to buy beauty products which are suitable to you with trying AR and depend on the previous user experience. This can be extended to any mobile platform and separate hardware produced for try-on in physical stores like cosmetic showrooms and beauty salons. 

Face foundations based on skin tone, lip-gloss and lipstick colors focused on lip shape, blusher types based on face form, hairstyles determined on face shape and hair type, and hair color based on the overall image are some of the options available.
